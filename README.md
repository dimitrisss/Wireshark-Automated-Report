# Packet Report Analysis

---

This project is in an early stage and provides foundational information on network packet analysis, focusing on open ports, potential attackers, and their associated MAC addresses. The aim is to offer a simple overview for users interested in understanding network security fundamentals.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes network packet data to identify:

- **Open Ports**: The open ports on a network that may be susceptible to unauthorized access or attacks.
- **MAC Addresses of Attackers**: The MAC addresses associated with potential attackers in the analyzed packets.

Understanding these aspects can help in securing networks against potential threats by recognizing vulnerabilities through open ports and identifying malicious entities by their MAC addresses.

## Usage

This code is in a development phase and is intended for educational and preliminary analysis purposes.

To get started:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. **Run the Packet Report script**:
   - Open a terminal and execute `Packet Report.py` in a Python environment.

> **Note**: This project requires libraries such as `scapy` for packet analysis.
